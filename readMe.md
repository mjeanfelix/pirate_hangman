Read Me file:

*Objective:*<br>Create a pirate themed hangman game, using HTML, CSS and Javascript.

User guesses the letters of a word. For every incorrect guess the image of a man in a noose appears. After six incorrect guesses the full image appears and the user loses. 
For each correct guess a letter appears in the empty spaces.

#Technologies Used
- Html
- CSS
- Javascript
- JQuery
- HP Scanner



# GETTING STARTED
---

Here is a link to Militza's Pirate Themed Hangman Game:

User Interaction:<br>
User is prompted to enter a guessed letter.



#Next Steps

Unsolved problems: <br>
I want the game to reset after a player is declared the loser, not just when they hit the reset button.
I want an image to flash across the screen when a player loses and I want to link that event to triggering a game restart.
